        <h1 class="game">Call of Duty Black Ops</h1>
        <p><img src="Famous Games/CoD_Black_Ops_cover.png" width="200" height="190" /></p>
        <p><em>Black Ops</em> is a first-person shooter, retaining the same gameplay mechanics as previous <em>Call of Duty</em> titles. The player assumes the role of a foot soldier who can wield various firearms (only two of which can be carried at once), throw grenades and other explosives, and use other equipment as weapons. A player   close enough to an enemy can kill with one knife blow. A character can   take three stances: standing, crouching or prone. Each affects rate of   movement, accuracy, and stealth. The player can drop to the prone stance   from the standing stance while running, and can momentarily sprint   before having to stop. The screen glows red to indicate damage to a   player's health, which regenerates over time. When the character is   within the blast radius of a live grenade, an on-screen marker indicates where it is in   relation to the player, helping the player to move away or to throw it   back. Among the weapons new to the series in <em>Black Ops</em> are crossbows with bolts and explosive ammunition, Dragon's Breath rounds and ballistic knives.</p>
        <p>The player assumes the role of various characters during the   single-player campaign, changing perspectives throughout the story. The   playable characters are special forces operatives conducting black operations behind enemy lines. In this way, the player's characters have their own traits such as voices and shadows. Each mission features a series of objectives that are displayed on the heads-up dilay,   which marks the direction and distance towards and from such objectives   as it has been in the earlier versions. The player is accompanied by   friendly troops throughout the game. Although primarily a first-person   shooter, certain levels feature sequences where the player pilots a Hind helicopter and guides friendly troops from a SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft. The campaign features several scripted cinematic moments. One of them is a bullet time effect during the &quot;Victor Charlie&quot; level, activated when the player fires toward the last enemy of a Viet Cong squad.</p>

        <h1 class="game">Call of Duty: Ghosts</h1>
        <p><img src="Famous Games/Call_of_duty_ghosts_box_art.jpg" width="200" height="190" /></p>
        <p dir="ltr">Like a good sequel should, Call of Duty: Ghosts doesn&rsquo;t ignore the formula of fast, fluid gameplay that has made the   series famous, but introduces a unique new premise, unprecedented player   personalization, and sweeping changes that breathe new life into the   multiplayer experience. It&rsquo;s over-the-top and at times unnecessarily   complex, but serves both current and next-generation consoles with   ambitious new ideas and tremendous replay value.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">Despite sharing a name with one of Modern Warfare&rsquo;s   best-known characters, Ghosts takes place in an entirely new Call of   Duty universe set in the not-too-distant future. In a genre overwrought   with antiquated Russian conflicts and ambiguous Middle Eastern terrorist   threats, Ghosts takes on a refreshingly unique premise in which the   threat comes not from the east, but the south: a federation of oil-rich   South American nations rises to take over the hemisphere, pushing north   and coming to blows with the U.S.</p>

        <h3><span id="Strike_Force_missions">Strike Force missions</span></h3>
        <p><em>Black Ops II</em> is the first <em>Call of Duty</em> video game to   feature branching storylines, in which the player's choice affects both   the current mission and in turn, the overall course of the story. Known   as &quot;Strike Force missions&quot;, these branching storylines appear during the   2025 storyline and feature permanent death.   The success or failure of these missions can have ramifications for the   wider campaign storyline. Choosing one of the missions locks out the   others unless the player begins a fresh campaign. Strike Force missions allow the player to control a number of different war assets, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, jet fighters and robots.   If the player dies in a Strike Force mission, the campaign continues   recording that loss, as opposed to letting the player load a previously   saved checkpoint. The player's progress in the Strike Force missions may   go on to change even the plans of the story's antagonist, Raul   Menendez.By the end of the game, the player may have changed the results of the   new Cold War, and the player is shown what could have gone differently.</p>
        <h3><span id="Zombies">Zombies</span></h3>
        <div>Treyarch has confirmed that the Zombies mode will return for <em>Black Ops II</em> with new game modes. Its predecessors were <em>Call of Duty: World at War</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em>. This is the third time for the Zombies mode to appear in a <em>Call of Duty</em> game, and the first time to have game modes other than the traditional   Survival mode. Treyarch has also confirmed that Zombies will run on the   game's multiplayer engine, allowing for a deeper community experience,   along with new features. A new, 8 player co-op game called &quot;Grief&quot; is   also supported, featuring 2 teams of 4 players competing to survive,   unlike <em>Call of Duty: World at War</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em>,   which only supported 4 player online co-op. As with the previous game,   each map contains &quot;Easter eggs&quot; side quests, which is used to progress   the story.</div>

        <p><img src="Famous Games/Diablo-3-wallpaper-rocketeer-diablo-dark1.jpg" width="200" height="190" /></p>
        <p>The game takes place in Sanctuary, the dark fantasy world of the <em>Diablo</em> series, twenty years after the events of <em>Diablo II</em>. Deckard Cain and Leah are in Tristram Cathedral (the same cathedral that was the setting of <em>Diablo</em>)   investigating ancient texts regarding an ominous prophecy. A mysterious   star falling from the sky strikes the Cathedral, creating a deep crater   into which Deckard Cain disappears.</p>
        <p>The protagonist arrives in the town of New Tristram to investigate   the falling star which struck the cathedral, which is now emanating   risen dead. The protagonist accompanies Leah to the cathedral in order   to rescue Cain from the crater into which he fell. After rescuing Cain,   the protagonist learns that the only way to the fallen star is to defeat   King Leoric, the former ruler of Tristram known now as the 'Skeleton   King'. Cain informs the protagonist that Leoric's crown must be   recovered to defeat him, and the protagonist searches for Leoric's crown   with the aid of Haedrig Eamon, the blacksmith of New Tristram. After   recovering the crown, the protagonist returns to the cathedral where he   eventually encounters and rescues Kormac, a warrior of the Templar order   who has been taken captive by members of a cult known as the Dark   Coven. Together, they defeat Leoric and find a stranger where the fallen   star landed. The stranger's only memory is of a sword that shattered   into three pieces as he fell.</p>

        <h1 class="game">Left 4 Dead</h1>
        <p><img src="Famous Games/index.jpg" width="200" height="190" /></p>
        <p><em><strong>Left 4 Dead</strong></em> (abbreviated <strong>L4D</strong>) is a singleplayer and multiplayer cooperative survival horror FPS game developed by VIP. The game was built using Source engine and is available on PC and Xbox 360. During early development, its working title was &quot;Terror Strike.&quot; The game puts four human playable or AI-controlled Survivors of an apocalyptic pandemic against hordes of the Infected. Regular Infected are controlled by the game AI, while human players can control up to four mutated Special Infected with special abilities in Versus mode. The goal of <em>Left 4 Dead</em> for the Survivors is to help each other make it through a level to safety. Infected players must cooperate to stop them. The basic gameplay never changes from map to map, so players will learn their way around fairly quickly. The Director keeps things from getting monotonous, however, by throwing in different   challenges in every level. No two playthroughs are exactly alike. </p>
