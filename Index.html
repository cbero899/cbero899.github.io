        <p align="left">Hello, my name is Caitlin Bero. I am a senior at Spring  Creek high school and I want to show you what I&rsquo;ve done in Mr. Conley&rsquo;s Graphic  Design and Web Design classes. Most of my work is from this year, as every year  I had to delete what I did the previous year to ensure I had room for my new years&rsquo;  work.<br />
          I was born August 4, 1997.<br />
          I moved to Spring Creek, Nevada my freshman year in 2011. <br />
          Mr. Conley has had me all four years. <br />
          When I graduate, I plan to go to college and become a  Registered nurse. I won&rsquo;t be able to pursue any of my work after I graduate. I  want to share it with all of you.</p>
