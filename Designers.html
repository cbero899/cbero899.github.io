            <h1 align="center" class="a">How many years have you worked in the field of game design?</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>My first boardgame was published in 1983. Since then   I've published two more board games, a roleplaying game and two dozen   roleplaying supplements, seven books, and over 250 articles, columns,   and reviews. From the 1990s onward I've worked mainly in computer games.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1 align="center" class="a">What are some of the most popular games you have created? </h1>
            <ul>
              <li>In 2003 I designed a simulation called &quot;Executive   Challenge&quot; for business school graduate students. A simulation is a kind   of game that closely imitates some real-world activity, such as a stock   market, a battle, or a business. You play the simulation to learn about   the real activity.</li>
              <li>The Executive Challenge simulation game teaches the   ethics of business. In October 2003 over a hundred students at the   University of Texas McCombs Business School played the game together,   all together in a single game lasting three days. It got news coverage   in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and in 2004 over 300 students in the   same school played the computer version. Since then several large   corporations have used the Executive Challenge to teach or test various   aspects of their business.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1 align="center" class="a">What type of degree would best prepare you for game design?</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Probably English would serve best. When you write game   rules, or even when you describe how a game works to a computer   programmer or artist, you must express yourself clearly and   grammatically. An English degree helps develop communication skills.</li>
              <li>However, no college degree in itself can make you a game   designer. Good design requires creativity and independence of thought,   qualities discouraged in many schools. You would do better to play a lot   of games, try to understand what parts of them work and don't work, and   educate yourself in the subjects you'd like to cover in your games.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>&quot;Game Designer Interview for 8th grade research paper.   Please review and respond if possible as soon as possible to my son's   research questionnaire attached for his class project. Please complete   and return via email by [three days from now] to [terse parent]. Thank   you for your participation.&quot; [...] &quot;I would be really grateful, if you   could find some time to read my email. I am a mother trying to help her   4th grade son obtain an interview from a computer game designer. He has   to participate in a final school project, which a big part of it is to   do an interview with a computer game designer.&quot;</li>
              <li>I get lots of these student inquiries -- it turns out   I'm on the first page of Google hits for the exact term &quot;game designer&quot;   -- so I'm posting answers here to the questions they always ask. I   expect no student will object; after all, the student never cares. The   list of questions is invariably trumped up by some well-meaning but   misguided teacher who commands everyone in the class to write to some   working stiff asking him to play job placement counselor.</li>
              <li>For an overworked teacher it must seem a wonderful idea:   Order the young underlings to solicit job data from two or three dozen   working adults, then have the little servants read them aloud. Why, that   fills up at least two class sessions! And really, what professional   figure would object to answering a few questions from one student?</li>
              <li>The teacher never considers for a moment that countless   other teachers across the nation are simultaneously issuing the same   command to their own cowed and spiritless charges. The students have no   genuine interest in the person targeted, yet they must obey orders --   and so they write. In their dozens, in their hundreds, they write.</li>
              <li>All these uninterested students head to Google, dully   type in &quot;game designer&quot; or &quot;firefighter&quot; or whatever, then fire off the   teacher's pre-made generic questions to the first e-mail address they   find. The working grownup on the receiving end of the flood of inquiries   must then answer each one, taking valuable work time to do so, or else   appear callous and hostile. The students collect the answers, read them   in class, check off that assignment, and never think about the matter   again. But at least the teacher has filled another empty hour of class.</li>
              <li>My heart goes out to these browbeaten students, but I must preserve my work time.</li>

            <div id="faq3">
              <h1 align="center" class="a">I have heard it is hard to find a teacher for game design. Is this true?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>Yes. Until someone figures out how to make a good game   without fail, no one will know how to teach it. It's a process of trial   and error.</li>
                <li>There are courses that teach the mechanics of creating   computer game levels, models, and textures. These are helpful technical   courses, but they don't teach much about how to make the game fun.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">If you were interested in the field of game design would it be smart to play a variety of different games?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>Yes. Play as many kinds of games as you can -- video and   computer games, card games, board games, roleplaying games. Decide   which ones you like, then figure out why. Try to analyze which parts of   the game work best, which don't work as well, and how you might change   the bad parts to work better.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">Why is it important to have more than one person creating a game?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>Every game design needs playtesting by many different   players. Usually each player tries a different strategy, and so the   designer can see which strategies pay off best. A good game design   permits many different strategies, balanced so they offer equal chances   of success. </li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">Would it be better to work with a company or work as your own business?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>Today it is easier than ever before to create and sell   certain kinds of games entirely on your own, over the Internet. Games   that consist of nothing but text, such as paper-and-pencil roleplaying   games, are best for this. So are small computer puzzle games and similar   casual games, like solitaire.</li>
                <li>For games that require substantial investments of cash   -- boardgames with lots of custom-made pieces, trading card games -- or   large numbers of people -- retail computer and video games -- you pretty   much have to work with a well-funded company.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">What does it take to make a successful game?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>Nobody knows. People just keep trying. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">How long does it take to make a successful game?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>Designing a good, fun game can take any amount of time   from an afternoon to many years. It depends on the game. Simple board   games may require a day or two to draft rules, then weeks or months to   playtest them until they work. Large computer games today typically   require teams of 20-60 people two years or more to develop.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">How many games would you need to create to lead a financially successful life?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>One -- if it's the right one. But some long-established   and widely respected designers who have published dozens or even   hundreds of games have never achieved great wealth. You don't design   games to get rich; you design them because it's fun and challenging. If   you can make money at it, that's a bonus.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">What is your job title?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>I don't have an actual title. I work freelance, which means I can work for any company that is willing to offer me a contract.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">What are your responsibilities?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>I create or edit the rules for many kinds of games: computer games, board and card games, and roleplaying games.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">What is a typical day like for you?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>I get up about 9 AM, walk the dog, surf the World Wide   Web until early afternoon, then write on my current design project until   dinner time. After dinner I walk the dog again, then surf the Web and   write some more until about 1 AM. Then I sleep, and when I wake up the   whole tedious cycle starts over again.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">What do you like most about your job?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>I like the wide variety of projects I can work on, and the freedom to set my own hours.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">How do you help this workplace meet its goals?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>This question is inapplicable to a freelancer. </li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">Why did you select this type of work?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>I enjoy playing games and found I had a talent for creating them.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">How much education do you need for this job?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>You do not need much formal education to be a game   designer. Perhaps junior-high school is sufficient, if you learn to   spell and type. But you must also be able to independently teach   yourself about a wide variety of subjects. Depending on the types of   games you design, you need to learn science, geography, economics, quite   a lot of history, programming, business, copyright law, and much more.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">Did you need more training after you have completed your education?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>Yes, I started my actual training as a game designer   after I had left school, by playing a lot of games and figuring out what   I liked and disliked about them.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">What grade level of reading do you use on this job?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>For most tasks, I need a high-school level of reading   (grade 10-12). Occasionally I must learn about an unusual or dense   subject, which may require college-level reading.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">How, if at all, do you use writing on the job?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>Everything I do involves writing.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">Is math important to your job?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>My particular type of game design calls for a good   command of arithmetic, to make sure all the values balance in the game   design. Other kinds of game design, such as computer programming, call   for much more difficult mathematics.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">When do you need to use good speaking skills to get your job done?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>I sometimes must present a game idea to a company and   persuade them to buy it. This calls for speaking skills, as well as an   awareness of the company's needs.</li>
              </ul>
              <h1 align="center" class="a">Do you ever have to work in teams on your job?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>Yes. Computer games require teams, sometimes very large teams. One designer may work with many programmers and artists.</li>
              </ul>
