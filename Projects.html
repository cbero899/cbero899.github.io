        <p><em><strong>The Sims 4</strong></em> is a 2014 life simulation video game developed by VIP and The Sims Studio and published by Electronic Arts. <em>The Sims 4</em> was originally announced on May 6, 2013, and was released in North America on September 2, 2014 for Microsoft Windows.A Mac release has been confirmed, but a date has not yet been announced, and there are currently no plans for a console release.</p>
        <p>The game has the same concept as its predecessor, <em>The Sims 3</em>. Players control their Sims in various activities and form relationships. The game, like the rest of the series, does not have a defined final goal; gameplay is nonlinear. The Create a Sim and Build Mode tools have been redesigned to allow more versatility when creating game content. Emotional state plays a larger role in gameplay than in previous games in the series, with effects on social interaction, user interface, and personality.</p>
