      <p align="center"><span class="heading"><em><strong>Requirements for a career at VIP</strong></em></span></p>
      <p align="center"><span class="bero2"><strong>Senior Game Developer:</strong></span></p>
      <p align="left">Here at <strong>VIP</strong>, we&rsquo;re working flat out to scientifically investigate what it   is that makes the best learning experience. By using real-time data to drive an   evidence based approach to education, we&rsquo;re developing an extraordinary new   technology for the classroom that is redefining the limits of what young people   can achieve and is helping us work out what works (and what doesn&rsquo;t) in the   field of education.</p>
      <p align="left">Imagine a classroom in which every student receives an individualised   learning experience. Imagine a classroom where we know what motivates each   student. Imagine a classroom in which a teacher has detailed insight into each   child&rsquo;s strengths and struggles. </p>
      <p align="left">We&rsquo;re looking for people with a deep passion for education and an interest in   how motivation plays its part, as well as a belief in the power of technology to   improve it. Things move fast at Sparx so we need people who assume excellence is   a given and who are ambitious, creative, and effortlessly knowledgeable in their   field. People who want a challenge; people who want to make a difference. </p>
      <p align="center"><span class="bero2"><strong>JOB DESCRIPTION </strong></span></p>
      <p align="left">As a Senior Games Developer at <strong>VIP</strong>, you&rsquo;ll be the one that makes work look   like play. Your one mission is to make learning as awesome, fun and addictive as   possible. You&rsquo;ll use your flair for making great games to get young people   motivated and loving learning and, as a result, truly transform their   futures.</p>
      <p align="left">You&rsquo;ll be responsible for designing, programming and testing high quality   games to run on a tablet platform (we currently work on iPads) for a variety of   subjects. Your games will need to get under the skin of what makes young people   tick and, working closely with the expert team around you, uncover exactly   what&rsquo;s going to help them get over each obstacle in understanding that they   face.</p>
      <p align="left">Things happen at breakneck speed at <strong>VIP</strong> and you&rsquo;ll have the freedom to do   whatever it takes to get from A to B. There are no hierarchies here, and no-one   micro-managing how you work. We have one shared ambition: to improve educational   outcomes for all.</p></td>

        <p align="left">You&rsquo;ve got a brilliant and established technical background, that&rsquo;s a given.   You&rsquo;ll have been playing games since a young age and trying to develop better   ones since you worked out where the &lsquo;P&rsquo; goes in programming.</p>
        <p align="left">What we&rsquo;re really interested in is your imagination, human insight, energy   and desire to use gaming to really make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives. You are   intrigued by what it is about a game that keeps people tuned in and coming back   for more.  You&rsquo;ve studied and analysed all the best games and have an   encyclopedic knowledge of how they were developed and how technology has evolved   to enhance gaming.</p>
        <p align="left">You have experience in the industry and a good few years of working on games   development under your belt. Regardless of whether you have been working on your   own previously, or with a group of people, you know you&rsquo;ll find a home in our   dynamic and eclectic team. You&rsquo;ll be obsessed with reaching perfection and   finding simple but elegant solutions to highly complex problems.</p>
      <p align="left">Things are always changing at <strong>VIP</strong> so we need people who can keep up.  You   don&rsquo;t have to be a specialist in education or a particular school subject – you   just need to know how to make a beautiful game.</p>
      <p align="center" class="bero2"><strong>OUR TEAM</strong></p>
      <p align="left">We&rsquo;re about living life, not putting it on hold. Our generous benefits   include substantial holiday leave and the chance to join our share scheme and   company pension once you&rsquo;ve completed your probationary period. We also have a   range of on-site facilities for all employees to use free of charge.

Plus,   we&rsquo;re constantly organizing events and activities to support our charities, and   to socialise. And while we&rsquo;re serious about our work, we want to have fun while   we do it!</p>
