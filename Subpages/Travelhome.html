      <td colspan="5"><h1 class="a2table">Welcome to Caitlin's Travel Log!!</h1>
        <p>I have three missions: To help you indulge your love of travel, whether you're on the road or staying home. To narrow down endless options (hotels, sites, destinations) to those that are special. And to find the best travel stories.</p>
        <p>These sites help us deliver all of the above, through their hotel intelligence, off-road adventures, great writing, and serious travel porn. We'll be collecting stories and dispatches from these amazing travelers regularly throughout the year. We're thrilled to get to know them better, and we hope you are, too.</p>
        <p>I don't really have an excuse to travel alone anymore, and I miss it.</p>
        <p>I miss the times when I'd check in for a flight and let my eyes wander around the waiting area at the gate, trying to guess who my seat-mate would be. I always hoped I'd make a friend, yet still asked for a window seat, so I could stare out the window instead of having an unwanted conversation if my neighbor turned out to be a dud, which is what usually happened. I always got paired with the most unappealing partner, one whose body mass — or, worse, smell — would expand over the arm rest into my territory. Even then, it was something to write about, to chuckle over silently.</p>
        <p>The best conversation always turns out to be the dialogue you have with yourself.</p>
        <p> When you're alone, every moment is an opportunity for something exciting to happen. There's nearly always room for one more, but usually not for two. </p>
        <p>The first time I traveled alone, I flew to London and took the Eurostar to Paris, where I was studying abroad. It was a transformative two-hour train ride because when I woke up, it was suddenly snowing and everyone was speaking French. When I ran my belongings through security at Gare du Nord, I unknowingly dropped my passport, only to have a stranger pick it up for me. The kindness of strangers shines through when you're freed from a set tribe of friends, marking you as one of their own. When you're alone, you belong to everyone.      </p>
        <p>A few years ago <em>I</em> wouldn&rsquo;t have even dreamed  I could travel long-term. The most we hoped for was to take a year-long around the world trip before returning to normal life. That was until we started reading travel blogs, particularly those written by long-term independent travellers who&rsquo;d somehow made travel a permanent part of their lifestyle.</p>
        <p>These travel bloggers were our best source of inspiration and practical advice in the years we were planning our trip. So, we wanted to acknowledge some of the best travel blogs that keep us entertained and inspired.</p>
