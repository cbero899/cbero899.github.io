        <p>Capital: Rome</p>
        <p>Italy, meaning the entire peninsula south of the Alps, is known as such from about the 1st century BC. Several centuries earlier, when the name first appears, it is used only of the area in the extreme south - the toe of the peninsula. 
In the 1st century BC Italy is under the control of a single power, Rome, and it will remain so until the 5th century AD. The peninsula again becomes a political entity, as the modern nation of Italy, in 1861. In all other periods of prehistory and history this most desirable of territories has been shared and fought over by numerous rival groups. Around 700 BC the majority of the tribes in Italy are relatively recent arrivals, either by land from the north or by sea across the Adriatic. They are Indo-Europeans, speaking the subgroup of languages known as Italic. But the dominant group at this time, the Etruscans, are of some different origin. Where they have come from remains a subject of much scholarly debate, but by about 500 BC they control much of central Italy. 
At this time the southern part of the peninsula, together with Sicily, is dominated by Greek colonies - settled in coastal regions from about 700 BC onwards</p>

        <p align="left">Rome wasn't built in a day--and you'll need much more than a day to take in this timeless city. The city is a real-life collage of piazzas, open-air markets, and astonishing historic sites. Toss a coin into the Trevi Fountain, contemplate the Colosseum and the Pantheon, and sample a perfect espresso or gelato before spending an afternoon shopping at the Campo de&rsquo;Fiori.</p>
        <h2 align="left"><u>Things to Do</u></h2>
        <p align="left">Rome is a popular travel destination in Italy full of attractions. Today's Rome, <em>Roma</em>, is a vibrant and lively city with reminders of its past everywhere. You'll encounter ancient Roman sites, medieval and Renaissance buildings and fountains, great museums, and beautiful squares. The city is a living museum of history from Roman times to present. It also boasts many fine restaurants, cafes, and good nightlife too.</p>

        <h2 align="left"><u>Getting here and there</u></h2>
        <p>The  public travel passes in Rome are very straight forward. No complicated zonal system, peak or off peak variations or anything like that. Your ticket is valid for all public transport, (city buses, metro, trams and some rail lines) within  the Rome urban area.Your only decision is whether you need a 1, 3 or 7   day pass. Travel pass prices are at the foot of this page along with the prices of individual tickets. The travel passes are for calendar days, not 24 hour periods, e.g. a 1 day pass expires at midnight on the day of use.</p>

        <h2 align="left"><u>History</u></h2>
        <p align="left">Legend says Rome was founded by Romulus in 713 BCE, but the origins probably predate this, from a time when the settlement was one of many on the Latium Plain. Rome developed where a salt trade route crossed the river Tiber en route to the coast, near seven hills the city is said to be built on. It&rsquo;s traditionally believed that the early rulers of Rome where kings, possibly Etruscans, who were driven out c. 500 BCE</p>
