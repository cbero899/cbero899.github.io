        <p class="france2"><strong>CAPITAL:</strong> <span class="paris2">Paris</span></p>
        <h4 class="france2">France remains the world's number one tourist  destination, and it's not hard  to understand why. France has it all - or more or less. It has tourist  sights for all tastes; it has some of the greatest beaches in  Europe, as well as the highest mountains and the finest historic  monuments,  the most beautiful cities, the most idyllic countryside, the most  magnificent castles, the finest rivers, and  plenty more, not to mention some of the best restaurants and the  finest wines and more hotels than any other country in Europe.<br />
        France has something for everyone,  which is one of  the reasons why it remains the world's number one tourist destination.  It has magnificent holiday opportunities for everything from a short  weekend city break, in places such as Paris,  Nice or Bordeaux, to a relaxed family holiday in a gite in the countryside, a week or two's relaxation by the seaside, or an  energetic break hiking, climbing, kayaking or cycling in France's great outdoors.   </h4>
        <h1 class="france2"><strong><em><u>Paris, France:</u></em></strong></h1>
        <p align="center"><img src="../PicturesUsed/Paris.jpg" width="355" height="205" /></p>
        <h4>Paris is   the political, cultural, and intellectual capital of France, and is   also the single-most visited city in the world. It has drawn waves of   immigrants, expatriate artists and intellectuals, and global traders for   centuries, attracting by virtue of its vibrant economy, rich political   and artistic history, unusual number of noteworthy tourist sites,   outstanding architecture and cultural life, and overall high standard of   living. Situated at the crossroads of Europe and in close range of the   English channel and other strategic places for military and trade, Paris   is a true powerhouse in continental Europe.</h4>
        <h2><u>Things to do?</u></h2>
        <p>Paris's seductive charms are legendary, and for good reason. Inviting   sidewalk cafes, gleaming boutiques, world-class museums, and a fabled   restaurant scene make Paris the runway model of cities—beautiful,   fashionable, confident, and inspiring envy at every turn. But with   expectations running so high, Paris can—yes, it's true—occasionally   disappoint. When you find yourself elbow to elbow with throngs of tennis   shoe-wearing tourists, tucking into yet another overpriced meal, you'll   wonder how the Paris that travelers fall in love with has proved so   elusive. Unless, that is, you read and discover how to avoid the top ten   mistakes first-timers make in the City of Light. </p>

        <h2><u>Getting here and around</u></h2>
        <p>If you are like me you will walk. This is for two reasons. One I like walking because it is <span id="IL_AD10">the best exercise</span> you can do and in a city like Paris there is plenty to see when   traveling on foot. The other reason is because I am mentally lazy and   for me it is easier to walk two hours to get somewhere then it is to   take two minutes to learn which bus or metro to take that will get me   there in ten minutes. Luckily there are plenty of people not like me   that keep  the buses and  metro in Paris in business.</p>
        <p align="left"><u><strong>The Metro:</strong></u></p>
        <p>The   Paris metro is one of the oldest and one of the best systems in the   world, right up there with London and New York. There are around 300   stations connected by nearly 300kilometers  of track. You can get within a couple blocks of anywhere you want to go.   The metro runs from 5am to 12:30am and for the <span id="IL_AD3">price</span> of a ticket you can ride around all day long if you like. (as long as you don't leave <span id="IL_AD5">the system</span>). <span id="IL_AD2">Tickets</span> can be bought at <span id="IL_AD11">the ticket</span> booth in the station one at a time, by ten or by 1-day, 2-day, 3-day, 5-day, Le Paris Viste tickets for tourists. There are also weekly and monthly tickets called the <strong>Carte Orange</strong>.   It's a travel pass good for unlimited travel on the paris metro and bus   network. You need a passport photo to buy this, but if you use the   metro a lot it's worth it. (more that  6-8 times a day). When you use your tickets stick it in the turnstyle <span id="IL_AD8">slot</span> and then take it when it is returned to you and keep it with you during   your trip. Occasionally the check and getting caught without one can be   embarrassing as well as expensive. You can get metro maps at the   stations and they are posted all over the system. You can also find them   in most of the guidebooks though some are so small you will need a   magnifying glass. If you can master the Paris metro system you will   travel around the city  in confidence and never want to leave. The maps are color-coded so all   you have to do is find the station you want to go to and find the line   that goes there and see what the final destination for that train is.   Then follow the signs for that destination and when the train comes get   on and just remember to get off at your stop.</p>

        <h2><u>History</u></h2>
        <p>The history of Paris goes back more than 2,000 years when some 60 Celtic   tribes called the Gauls inhabited the region, most notably in the Paris   Basin on the Ile de la Cité. One of their tribes, the Parisii,   eventually gave their name to the present-day city. The Gauls were   composed of warrior tribes who hunted, fished, and lived in huts with   thatched roofs. Their religion, called druidism, celebrated nature. Many   present day religious festivals include remnants of druidic worship.   The main festival, <em>la fête du gui</em> (mistletoe), welcomed in the   new year. They also burned the Yule log to celebrate the return to light   after a long dark season of winter. Their chief warrior, Vercingétorix,   was defeated by the Roman army under Julius Caesar (c. 100–44 B. C. )   in about 50 B. C. The Romans renamed the Gaulish capital Lutetia, which   it remained until it was reconquered by a Germanic tribe called the   Franks—hence the name for present day France (land of the Franks). Their   king, Clovis (465–511) converted to Christianity and took the old name   of Paris for its capital. By brute force, Clovis established the   Merovingian dynasty of kings and established a code of laws known as the   Salic Law. In 800, Charlemagne (747–814) moved his capital from   Aix-la-Chapelle to Paris, thus solidifying Paris as the permanent   capital city of what would become modern day France. Between 900 and   1000, another tribe of invaders called Vikings (actually Norsemen)   repeatedly invaded and pillaged Paris until they eventually became a   civilized part of the community.</p>
